Place real Fredoka WOFF2 font files in `woff2/` and keep the CSS in `css/fredoka.css`.

Currently these are placeholders â€” replace `fredoka-regular.woff2` and `fredoka-600.woff2` with real font files (licensed copies) before production.

Example structure:

static/fonts/fredoka/css/fredoka.css
static/fonts/fredoka/woff2/fredoka-regular.woff2
static/fonts/fredoka/woff2/fredoka-600.woff2

Then commit these files so they are available in production builds.
