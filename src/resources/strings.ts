          `They keep us glued to endless feeds instead of enjoying each other’s profiles.`,

        highlight: "1. The Feed vs. Real Profiles",
        p: `When was the last time you explored a friend’s profile for more than a few minutes? Chances are, not often. That’s because most profiles look the same — plain, predictable, and, if we're being honest, somewhat boring.`,
        link: "",
        p1: `Instead, we find ourselves lost in an endless stream of videos, ads, and sponsored posts. Apps are designed this way to keep us scrolling! TikTok even figured out it takes about 250 videos to get someone hooked. That’s why most of our energy goes into consuming content from strangers instead of appreciating and participating in the lives of the people we actually know.`,
      },
      point3: {
        highlight: "2. The Numbers Game",
        p: `Social media today is all about the numbers: likes, followers, views, reactions. Have you ever hesitated to share something because your last post didn’t get “enough” likes? You’re not alone. Celebrities and influencers dominate the feed because they bring more money and attention to the platforms, so their content gets boosted far more than posts from our friends.`,
        p1: `Suddenly, social media feels less like self-expression and more like a popularity contest. Chasing “viral” status is exhausting, and for many of us, it takes the joy out of sharing.`,
        p2: `No wonder so many people turn into “lurkers,” quietly scrolling and reacting with the occasional heart emoji instead of posting anything about themselves.`,
      },
      point4: {
        highlight: "3. No Room for Creativity",
        p: `Here’s the biggest missed opportunity: freedom.`,
        p1: `Most platforms give us cookie-cutter profiles with little to no room for creativity. That might have worked years ago, but now, people crave individuality. We’re not just “users” — we’re people with hobbies, talents, passions, and unique personalities. We are more than content for social media feeds. Our souls are akin to universes, expanding and changing.`,
        p2: `So why shouldn’t our profiles reflect that? Imagine if we could design our profiles exactly how we wanted, with our own colors, fonts, assets, and layout. Imagine owning a space on the internet that truly reflects who we are vs another template everyone uses.`,
      },
      point5: {
        highlight: "Enter SoulPad",
        p: `SoulPad flips the script. Instead of endless feeds and cookie-cutter profiles, we focus on you. Your creativity. Your individuality. Your way of sharing and connecting.`,
        p1: `With SoulPad, you get the freedom of an infinite canvas to design your profile how you want — easily, playfully, and without the pressure of likes, followers, or algorithms deciding who matters most.`,
        p2: `It’s time for social media to feel fun again. Let’s bring the focus back to self-expression and genuine connection.`,
