        highlight: "1. The Feed vs. Real Profiles",
        p: `When was the last time you explored a friend’s profile for more than a few minutes? Chances are, not often. That’s because most profiles look the same — plain, predictable, and, if we're being honest, somewhat boring.`,
        link: "",
        p1: `Instead, we find ourselves lost in an endless stream of videos, ads, and sponsored posts. Apps are designed this way to keep us scrolling! TikTok even figured out it takes about 250 videos to get someone hooked. That’s why most of our energy goes into consuming content from strangers instead of appreciating and participating in the lives of the people we actually know.`,
      },
      point3: {
        highlight: "2. The Numbers Game",
        p: `Have you ever felt less interested in expressing yourself on social media because the number of likes or views on your last post weren’t as high as other people? Social media celebrities are a real thing. We spend more time on their content because they bring more attention and money to social media companies. As a result, their stuff gets promoted way more than our friends’ profiles. `,
        p1: `Sometimes it feels like we’re all in a race or under pressure to be more popular, engaging, or have higher numbers – it’s like a second job! That’s because if we **go viral** on social media, we might become millionaires like all the other social media celebrities. But trying to go viral can be tiring or maybe we become too embarrassed by our low likes or views that we give up on sharing after a time.`,
        p2: `That could be why some of us become “lurkers” – people who share little to nothing on social media but instead lurk on the feed of popular folks or mindlessly react to content with a heart or other emoji. The popular social media apps want us to gobble up popular content because ads instead of expressing ourselves or connecting with our friends and new people in unique ways.`,
      },
      point4: {
        highlight: "3. No Room for Creativity",
        p: `Giving everyone the same design for profile pages may have worked in the early days of social media apps, but now, in the age of generative AI, we need to showcase our human creativity more than ever. Our profiles need more attention than the timelines and feeds.`,
        p1: `Where is the focus on our individuality vs “content creators” for the feed?  We are a universe of thoughts, interests, hobbies, talents and so much more. SoulPad’s mission is to restore this balance by giving you the freedom to express your point of view online in the easiest way possible. `,
