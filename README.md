## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow

To keep our project history clean and manageable, please follow this workflow for all contributions. This ensures that pull requests can be reviewed and merged smoothly.

### Step 1: Fork and Configure Your Remotes (One-Time Setup)

If you haven't already, configure your local repository to track the original "upstream" repository. This allows you to pull in changes from the main project.

```bash
# Add the main repository as a remote named "upstream"
git remote add upstream [https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git](https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git)

# Verify the remotes are configured
git remote -v
# origin    [https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git](https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git) (fetch)
# origin    [https://github.com/your-username/soul-pad-beta.git](https://github.com/your-username/soul-pad-beta.git) (fetch)
# origin    [https://github.com/your-username/soul-pad-beta.git](https://github.com/your-username/soul-pad-beta.git) (push)
# upstream  [https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git](https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git) (fetch)
# upstream  [https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git](https://github.com/csevere/soul-pad-beta.git) (push)
```

### Step 2: Sync Your Fork Before Starting New Work

Before creating a new branch, always make sure your `main` branch is up-to-date with the `upstream` repository.

```bash
# Switch to your local main branch
git checkout main

# Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository
git fetch upstream

# Merge the upstream changes into your local main branch
git merge upstream/main
```

### Step 3: Create and Work on a Feature Branch

Create a new branch for your task from your updated `main` branch.

```bash
# Create a new branch with a descriptive name
git checkout -b my-awesome-feature
```

Now, make your code changes and commit them.

### Step 4: Rebase to Include Upstream Changes

Before you submit a pull request, other changes may have been merged into the `upstream/main` branch. You need to incorporate these changes into your feature branch using **rebase**.



This rewrites your branch's history to place your commits on top of the latest `main` branch commits, avoiding a "merge bubble" and keeping history linear.

```bash
# Make sure you are on your feature branch
git checkout my-awesome-feature

# Fetch the latest upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch on top of the latest changes from upstream/main
git rebase upstream/main
```

**If you encounter conflicts** during the rebase, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them.
1.  Fix the conflicting files in your editor.
2.  Stage the resolved files: `git add .`
3.  Continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`
4.  If you get stuck, you can abort: `git rebase --abort`

### Step 5: Push and Create a Pull Request

After a successful rebase, you will need to "force push" your changes to your fork (`origin`). Because rebase rewrites history, a normal `git push` will be rejected. Use `--force-with-lease` as a safer alternative to `--force`.

```bash
# Push the rebased branch to your fork.
git push --force-with-lease origin my-awesome-feature
```

Now you can go to GitHub and open a pull request from your `my-awesome-feature` branch! üéâ
